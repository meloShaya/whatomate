## Overview

Campaigns allow you to send bulk WhatsApp messages to multiple contacts at once. Whether you're sending promotional offers, updates, or notifications, Whatomate handles the delivery efficiently while respecting WhatsApp's rate limits.

## Creating a Campaign

<Steps>

1. **Select Template**

   Choose an approved message template for your campaign.

2. **Define Audience**

   Select contacts or upload a contact list for targeting.

3. **Set Variables**

   Configure template variables for personalization.

4. **Schedule (Optional)**

   Schedule the campaign for a specific date and time.

5. **Review & Send**

   Review the campaign details and send or schedule it.

</Steps>

## Adding Recipients

You can add recipients to your campaign in two ways:

### Manual Entry

Add recipients one at a time by entering:
- **Phone Number** - The recipient's WhatsApp number (with country code)
- **Name** - Optional display name
- **Parameters** - Template variable values for personalization

### CSV Upload

For bulk imports, upload a CSV file with your recipient data:

<Steps>

1. **Prepare Your CSV**

   Create a CSV file with columns for phone number, name, and template parameters:
   ```csv
   phone,name,param1,param2
   +1234567890,John Doe,Order #123,December 25
   +0987654321,Jane Smith,Order #456,December 26
   ```

2. **Upload and Validate**

   The system automatically validates your CSV against the selected template:
   - Checks for required phone number column
   - Validates parameter count matches template requirements
   - Detects duplicate phone numbers
   - Shows validation errors per row

3. **Review and Import**

   Preview the validation results before importing:
   - View first 50 rows with status indicators
   - See error details for invalid rows
   - Only valid rows will be imported

</Steps>

  **CSV Column Names**: The system recognizes various column names:
  - Phone: `phone`, `phone_number`, `mobile`, `number`
  - Name: `name`, `contact_name`, `customer_name`
  - Parameters: `param1`, `param2`, etc. or `variable1`, `variable2`, etc.

<Aside type="caution">
  **Duplicate Detection**: If the same phone number appears multiple times in your CSV, only the first occurrence will be valid. Subsequent duplicates will be flagged as errors.
